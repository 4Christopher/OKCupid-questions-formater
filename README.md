# Overview
This script formats the JSON file generated by [OKCupid questions downloader](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/62703) in a human readable way and prints it (using colors for highlighting) in the terminal.

I first wrote it in Perl and implemented it afterwards also in Python. Boat scripts are functionally almost identical.

# Usage
To use it you have to specify the filename in the perl script and afterwards run the script.
You can also search for questions using regular expressions as known from perl.
