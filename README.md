# Overview
This script formats the JSON file generated by [OKCupid questions downloader][]
in a human readable way and prints it (using colors for highlighting) in the
terminal.

I first wrote it in Perl and implemented it afterwards also in Python. Boat
scripts are functionally almost identical.  But I still recommend the Perl
implementation because it is more feature complete.

# Usage
To use it you have to specify the filename in the perl script and afterwards
run the script.  You can also search for questions using regular expressions as
known from Perl. I also added some configuration options that you can easily
change in the script(s).
